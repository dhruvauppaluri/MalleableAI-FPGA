"""Performance on the RTL: lower bounds on how close MLP and attention decode get to the DRAM roofline.

The roofline of a program is the number of transfers it needs on the slice's DRAM burst port
(one D-byte chunk per cycle; the MXU consumes chunks at the same rate) -- see profile.py. These
tests pin the achieved fraction so that an RTL or compiler change cannot silently lose it.

The simulated DRAM delivers one D-byte chunk per cycle, the MXU's peak rate; the FPGA's DDR3
delivers well under half of that, so on the board the (deeply pipelined) vector and quantizer
work has correspondingly more room behind the weight stream.
