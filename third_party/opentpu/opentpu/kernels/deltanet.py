"""Gated DeltaNet decode step (Qwen3-Next / Qwen3.5 linear attention), one token.

The recurrent state of a head is kept transposed, St[j, i] = S[i, j] with rows j over the value
dimension and columns i over the key dimension, so both contractions are row reductions (RDOT)
and the rank-1 update is row x column (OUTER). Per head:

    kv = St @ k                   RDOT        (on the old state; the decay is applied to kv)
    d  = (v - a * kv) * beta      3 small VOPs

    o  = St @ q                   RDOT

three passes over the fp32 state, which streams through TMEM (LD before, ST after).

    tile shared by all heads (kv, then d). `prefetch` loads the next head's state; it is
    called as early as TMEM allows.

    The schedule: a TMEM bank takes one write per cycle and the DMA's writes come first, so a
    state LD (8 writes per cycle) stalls an OUTER (8 per cycle) for as long as they overlap;
    an RDOT writes nothing until its last row and runs beside it. Sharing w makes head h+1's
    first RDOT wait for head h's OUTER, so head h's last RDOT (older) goes first; the LD of
    head h+2, which reuses head h's buffer, then waits for that RDOT and head h's ST, and
    lands during head h+1's first RDOT.

    fused=False is the same step on the ISA without RDOT and OUTER (named temporaries are
    never fused): 7 state passes instead of 3. Every one of them writes TMEM, so a state LD
    could not overlap any of them anyway, and they need two 16K-word temporaries: the states
