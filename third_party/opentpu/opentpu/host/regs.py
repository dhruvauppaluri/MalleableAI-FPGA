"""The control register map of the board (docs/observability.md; otpu_ctrl.sv, otpu_trace.sv).

Byte offsets from BAR0, 32-bit registers. Version 1 bitstreams implement 0x00..0x38 only and
decode 8 address bits: an unknown register reads 0xDEADBEEF, and an offset >= 0x100 aliases
into 0x00..0xFF (so the counters and the trace registers must not be read before REGMAP says
2). REGMAP (0x3C) reads 0xDEADBEEF on version 1; 0 is treated the same (a map with the
register tied off). Version 3 adds the MXU_STARVE counter; a version 2 bitstream reads
0xDEADBEEF there, so the host reads only counters(regmap).
