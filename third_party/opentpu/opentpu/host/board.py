"""Host driver for the openTPU board (YPCB-00338 over PCIe, Xilinx XDMA).

The card exposes, through the XDMA bridge:
  - its two DDR3 channels on the bridge's AXI master: channel c at BASE[c] (2 GiB each),
    written with /dev/xdma0_h2c_0 and read with /dev/xdma0_c2h_0 (file offset = AXI address);
  - the control registers (rtl/boards/ypcb-00338/otpu_ctrl.sv; map in regs.py and
    docs/observability.md) on BAR0, /dev/xdma0_user.

The accelerator addresses one logical DRAM interleaved over the channels in 64-byte beats
(logical beat b lives on channel b % 2 at BASE[b % 2] + (b // 2) * 64; rtl/mem/otpu_axi_dram.sv).
This driver applies the same map, so the host works with logical addresses only.

BoardBackend implements the Engine backend interface (write / read / run, plus prepare and
attach), so `Engine(..., cfg=device_config(board.info()), backend=BoardBackend)` runs Qwen3,
LFM2 or Qwen3.5 on the card; device_config takes MCOLS and LANES from the bitstream's VERSION
register. With transport=SimTransport the identical protocol runs against the Verilator model
of the board (sim/verilator/tb_board.sv) -- the bring-up rehearsal.

A Board takes the device's exclusive lock (runstate.DeviceLock, /tmp/otpu/<dev>.lock) when its
transport names a device (XdmaTransport, FakeTransport); monitors pass lock=False. Register map
version 1 bitstreams (no REGMAP register) work for everything but the counters, the trace and
the temperature: info() reports regmap 1 and snapshot() returns None.
